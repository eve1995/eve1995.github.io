                <p>Your Salmon River Rafting rafting trip begins in the lower 100 miles of the canyon. Here, 
                    the Salmon River's famous rapids, though still exciting, are a bit tamer. The scenery 
                    is astounding. Massive sandstone cliffs conjure up imaginary shapes. Hidden waterfalls and 
                    pools carve their way down to the river. Wildlife is abundant, with frequent sightings of 
                    elusive Blue Heron, soaring hawks and eagles, and majestic Big Horn sheep. At night, the canyon 
                    walls unveil a heaven of innumerable stars. Come join us on an incredible and 
                    unforgettable Salmon River rafting journey.</p>
